            <p>Starting from December 1, 2024, China will provide zero-tariff treatment for 100 percent of tariff lines to all least developed countries with established diplomatic relations, including 33 African nations. This makes China the first major developing country and major economy to implement such a significant measure. The move has been hailed as a demonstration of enhanced cooperation between China and Africa. In recent years, this cooperation has undergone substantial expansion, focusing on areas such as social development, digital economy, and environmental protection. China has played a crucial role in helping many African countries address food security issues, bridge the digital divide, and strive for green, low-carbon, and sustainable development. At the 2024 Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), both sides further deepened their collaboration on global issues. As the continent faces numerous challenges, including economic difficulties and the adverse impact of climate change, cooperation with Africa is vital from a humanitarian perspective. How does China's cooperation with Africa contribute to the continent's humanitarian efforts? How is this cooperation perceived by African people? The Global Times reporter Xie Wenting (GT) talked to Patrick Youssef, regional director for Africa at the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), on those topics and more. </p>
